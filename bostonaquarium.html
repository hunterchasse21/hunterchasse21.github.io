<h1>Boston Aquarium Trip</h1>

<p> During the summer after graduating high school, my girlfriend and I went to Boston to check out the aquarium and explore the city. 
I hope you enjoy these images I captured on the trip! </p>

<p>I love exploring and finding out new things. Fish are especially curious to me because I have never really learned about them!
This trip was a great opportunity to find out new information and see things I never had before. </p>
