<p> After college I am hoping to get a job as a financial advisor. I would like to live in New England somewhere along the coast or by water. 
I am an animal lover and would like to have two dogs and drive a Mercedes Benz. </p>

<p> After I am retired, a long time from now, I would like to improve my golf game and go golfing most days. </p>
